<!--
Resources that are referenced

For each resource bundle that you define you need to add one resource definition.
Each resource definition consists out of:

name: the name of the file (without .properties extension), which is at the
same point of time the name you define within the expression (#{rr.name.xyz})

package: the Java package in which the resource file is kept. This tells the resource
editor where to place and update the resoruce files. The Java source directory is part
of the project definition - together with the package definition the resource editor
will find the right file location.

defaultvalue (optional): default value that is returned if a property could not
be resolved (e.g. because it is missing in the resource bundle). By default a string
is returned showing the name of the resource and the name of the property. When defining
defaultvalue as "null" then null is returned at runtime.
